## About Me
    
    I wrote a website with some information about me that utilizes a JavaScript program to quiz the user as to certain
    details about me.

### Reflections and Comments

    I am trying to follow submission guidelines, scaffolding, and project guidelines to the strictest degree I have yet
    attained in submitting assignments for DeltaV Code School's 201 course. I enjoy the inherant challenge in making fewer
    mistakes that ever before and pushing myself to produce the optimal content that my instructors and any possible
    employers expect to see from those who are willing to push themselves to excel.
